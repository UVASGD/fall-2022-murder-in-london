Constable George: Greetings, Detective Christine. Thank you for taking the case. Our victim is Leroy Lewis.
Christine: The actor?
Constable George: Yes. Lewis’ newest film "Out with a Bang!" premiered tonight. Hundreds of guests were in attendance. Lewis was found by his Manager Kent, dead in the booth.
Constable George: The circumstances of his death are quite shocking. Leroy Lewis was a big personality with a huge fan following. 
Christine: You’re right. I can’t believe he went out like that. 
Constable George: With a Bang?
Christine: May I see the booth?
Constable George: Right this way.
Christine: It appears he has been shot.
Constable George: A giant bullet wound in the chest, I’m afraid. At least while  dying, he finally became a holy man.
Constable George: Anyways, like I said, he was found by his manager in his private booth the morning after the premeire. But based on the body, time of death would have been some time during the premeire.
Christine: He died during the premeire? Didn't you say the was theater packed?
Constable George: Yep, and not one of the moviegoers reported any gunshots. But by the body, he was definitely shot, and it was definitely during the premeire.
Christine: Has a murder weapon been found?
Constable George: No, we are still looking for that.
Christine: Do we have any suspects?
Constable George: Yes. We’ve narrowed it down to three. All of them had the opportunity to enter Leroy’s booth at that time.
Constable George: Their names are Viola Villin, Kent El De-Truth, and Agnes Painsworth.
Christine: Right, because their names don’t make them suspect enough.
Christine: I'm going to take a look around the murder scene. Once I've gotten some evidence, I'll start questioning your suspects.
